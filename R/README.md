# MC-AR - A software suite for comparative mocap analysis in an augmented reality environment (R-part)

## 0. Intruduction
The analysis employs four distinct models to test various hypotheses related to student performance in a virtual violin learning environment. The first two models, Model_1 and Model_2, focus on kinematic metrics derived from student interactions with a virtual teacher. Model_2 differs from Model_1 by including perceived difficulty as an additional factor.
The subsequent two models, Model_3 and Model_4, incorporate behavioral metrics from questionnaires, specifically three presence questionnaires. The primary difference between Model_3 and Model_4 lies in the inclusion of kinematic metrics in the interaction with the condition in Model_4.

## 1. R Version
This package is compatible with R version 3.0.1. or higher.

## 2. Package Setup and Usage
Run .Rmd scripts successively from 01_Initialization.Rmd to 05_Results.Rmd. If a power analysis is required, run 06_PowerAnalysis.Rmd. For a summary of the results with explanations, run 07_Summary.Rmd.
